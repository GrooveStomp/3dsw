- Texturing is not working.
  - Works properly sometimes.
  - Backfaces of cube seem to not be showing texturing
  - Lots of blue. The edgs of the texture are blue; are (u,v) being clamped?
  - At triangle edges the texture bleeds outside the edge of the cube.
- x coordinate seems to be facing the wrong way for model?
    > inputs all work as expected, so vector math seems okay
    > "fixed" this by flipping X coords on the model in Blender.
- Make PutPixelScaled work again.
